\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis investigates a generalized model of kidney exchange where each patient may be accompanied by up to two proxy donors. We formally define this multi-donor setting and analyze its computational and strategic implications. Through reductions from classical NP-complete problems, we establish the hardness of all variants and explore their approximability. We propose effective approximation algorithm with proven bound and analyze incentive properties under strategic donor selection, introducing a randomized mechanism to ensure truthfulness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is not only theoretically robust but also practically viable. Optimal solutions can be obtained within minutes for realistic instance sizes, and the presence of multiple donors substantially improves match rates. These findings highlight the potential of multi-donor frameworks in enhancing the efficiency and equity of kidney exchange programs.
