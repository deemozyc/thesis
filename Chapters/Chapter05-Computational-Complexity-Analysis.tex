\chapter{Computational Complexity Analysis}
\label{cha:computational_complexity_analysis}

This chapter investigates the computational complexity of the algorithmic problems introduced in our multi-donor kidney exchange model. We formalize the decision versions of these problems and show that they are NP-complete, even under seemingly simple constraints.

We begin by presenting several variants of the problem that differ in the allowed structure of exchanges—such as the maximum length of cycles and whether chains are permitted. We then prove that all of these variants are computationally intractable via reductions from known NP-complete problems. These results motivate the need for approximation algorithms and heuristic methods, which will be discussed in later chapters.

\section{Problem Variants and Overview of Results}

All problem variants considered in this chapter revolve around structural constraints imposed on the kidney exchange process—specifically, limitations on the maximum length of allowed exchange cycles and chains.

We begin by showing that for any fixed constant $k \ge 2$, the decision version of the \textsc{$k$-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is NP-complete. This result is established via a reduction from the \textsc{Longest Path from Fixed Source} problem.

Subsequently, we consider an even more restricted setting where only 2-cycles and 1-chains are permitted. Despite the simplicity of this variant, we show that the corresponding decision problem remains NP-complete, using a reduction from the \textsc{2P2N 3-SAT} problem.



\section{Reduction from Longest Path}

In this section, we formally establish the computational hardness of the matching problems defined in our multi-donor kidney exchange model. Specifically, we show that even under simple structural constraints—such as allowing only one 2-cycle and unrestricted chains—the decision version of the problem remains NP-complete. 

Our proofs are based on a polynomial-time reduction from the well-known \textsc{Longest Path from Fixed Source} problem in directed graphs.

\subsection{NP-completeness of the 2-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Problem}

Here we show that the \textsc{2-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is at least as hard as the \textsc{Longest Simple Path in Directed Graph} problem.

To establish NP-completeness, we reduce from the well-known \textsc{Longest Path from Fixed Source} problem (\autoref{prob:longest_simple_path}). Given an instance $(G, s, k)$ of that problem, we construct an instance of our problem such that a solution to our problem implies a solution to the original one.

\begin{lemma}
The decision version of the \textsc{2-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is NP-complete.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
We prove NP-hardness by reduction from the \textsc{Longest Path from Fixed Source} problem. Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, a designated source node $s$, and an integer $k$, we construct an instance of the \textsc{2-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange} problem such that there exists a solution saving at least $3 + 2k$ patients if and only if there exists a simple path of length at least $k$ starting from $s$ in $G$.

To construct the kidney exchange instance, we begin by adding a single 2-cycle between two patients, where one of the patients is associated with two donors: one donor participates in the 2-cycle, and the other is compatible with the patient corresponding to node $s$ in $G$. This setup initiates the only possible chain in the instance.

Next, for each vertex $v \in V$, we create a corresponding patient-donor pair; $p_v$, $d_v$. For every directed edge $(a, b) \in E$, we introduce a new intermediate patient-donor pair; $p_{ab}$, $d_{ab}$, and add two compatibility edges; $(d_a, p_{ab})$ and $(d_ab, p_b)$. This models each edge as a two-step donation chain segment, as shown in \autoref{fig:longest_path_edge_gadget}.

    \caption[Edge gadget used in reduction from Longest Path from Fixed Source problem.]{Edge gadget used in reduction from Longest Path from Fixed Source problem.}
    \label{fig:longest_path_edge_gadget}
\end{figure}


In the resulting kidney exchange instance, only the single 2-cycle we constructed initially is eligible to be selected under the problem constraints. Chains can only be initiated from this 2-cycle and must respect donor compatibility. Since all other potential cycles in the graph (formed via edge constructions) involve at least four patients, no other 2-cycles exist in the instance.

Therefore, maximizing the number of patients who receive a kidney corresponds to finding the longest simple path in $G$ starting from $s$. Each edge in $G$ contributes two transplantations (through the intermediate patient-donor pair), and the initial 2-cycle saves two patients, plus one more as the entry to the chain. Hence, the total number of patients saved is at least $3 + 2k$ if and only if there exists a simple path of length at least $k$ in the original graph.

An example instance of \textsc{Longest Path from Fixed Source} problem and its corresponding reduction to the instance of the \textsc{2-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange} problem is shown in \autoref{fig:longest_path_graph_example}.

The orange 2-cycle on the left initiates the longest available chain consisting of 7 transplantations. The solution sums up to 9 patients saved in total.}

Membership in NP is immediate, since a proposed matching (i.e., a set of selected cycles and chains) can be verified in polynomial time.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Extensions to \texorpdfstring{$k$}{k}-Cycle Constraints}

We now extend the previous hardness result to two broader settings, where the constraint on the length of cycles is generalized from length 2 to an arbitrary constant $k \ge 2$.

\begin{lemma}
For any fixed constant $k \ge 2$, the decision version of the \textsc{$k$-Cycle Unbounded-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is NP-complete.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
The proof follows a similar reduction as in the 2-cycle case, with a crucial modification: instead of constructing a 2-cycle to initiate the chain, we construct a cycle of length exactly $k$. We ensure that this is the only cycle in the constructed instance whose length is at most $k$.

To achieve this, we modify the edge gadgets from the original reduction. Each edge $(a, b)$ is now represented by an expanded chain segment, composed of additional intermediate patients and donors, such that any cycles inadvertently formed from these components are of length strictly greater than $k$. This guarantees that under the $k$-cycle constraint, the only valid cycle is the one we intentionally constructed for initiating the chain.

Thus, as in the 2-cycle case, any feasible solution must rely on a single chain starting from the constructed $k$-cycle. The total number of patients that can be served remains a function of the chain's length, which in turn corresponds to the length of a simple path in the original graph. Therefore, the reduction remains valid for arbitrary fixed $k$.
\end{proof}



\section{Reduction from 2P2N-3SAT}

In the following two lemmas, we show that for all $N = \{n : n \ge 2\} \cup \{\infty\}$ and $M = \{m:m \ge 1\} \cup \{\infty\}$, \textsc{N-Cycle M-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is computationally hard. This result is established via a reduction from the \textsc{2P2N-3-SAT} problem (\autoref{prob:2p2n_3sat}). 

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:2c1c_npc}
The decision version of the \textsc{2-Cycle 1-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is NP-complete.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
We prove NP-hardness via a reduction from the \textsc{2P2N-3-SAT} problem. Let $\phi$ be a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form, consisting of a set of clauses $C$ and a set of variables $X$, where each clause $c \in C$ contains exactly three literals, and each variable $x \in X$ appears in at most two clauses as a positive literal $x$ and in at most two clauses as a negative literal $\neg{x}$. We construct a corresponding instance of the \textsc{2-Cycle 1-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} such that $\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if there exists a feasible exchange satisfying at least a certain number of patients $t$ (specified below).

In the construction, each clause $c \in C$ is represented as a patient-donor pair $(p_c, d_c)$. For each variable $x \in X$, we construct a special gadget illustrated in \autoref{fig:sat_reduction_boolean_gadget}. The gadget consists of patient-donor groups forming four overlapping cycles and four patient-donor pairs representing two negative literals ($\neg{x}$) and two positive literals ($x$). The gadget is designed so that either the two patients representing the positive literals $p_x$ are satisfied (as shown in \textbf{(b)}), or the two patients representing the negative literals $p_{\neg{x}}$ are satisfied (as shown in \textbf{(c)}), but never both $p_x$ and $p_{\neg{x}}$ simultaneously. The patients representing clauses and those representing literals are the same nodes in our construction. For example, given a clause $c = (x_1, \neg{x_2}, x_3)$, we identify $p_c = p_{x_1} = p_{\neg{x_2}} = p_{x_3}$. Each patient can represent only one clause, and if a patient representing a literal is not associated with any clause, we omit that patient and their corresponding proxy donor from the construction.

\end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:sat_reduction_boolean_gadget}, notice that no matter which pair of cycles is selected, the four patients $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, and $p_4$ always receive compatible kidneys. If $\phi$ is satisfiable, then in our construction all patients representing clauses ${ p_c : c \in C }$ receive compatible kidneys in every optimal solution. Conversely, if $\phi$ is not satisfiable, then in every solution there exists at least one patient representing a clause who does not receive a compatible kidney. This gives rise to the threshold $t = 4 \cdot |X| + |C|$, indicating that the solution to the constructed instance of the \textsc{2-Cycle 1-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} satisfies $t$ patients if and only if $\phi$ is satisfiable.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:2n1m_npc}
For all $N = \{n : n \ge 2\} \cup \{\infty\}$ and $M = \{m:m \ge 2\} \cup \{\infty\}$, The decision version of the \textsc{N-Cycle M-Chain Multi-Donor Kidney Exchange Problem} is NP-complete.

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
This proof is almost identical to the one of \autoref{lemma:2c1c_npc}. What changes is the structure of the variable gadget and the threshold $t$. This time the variable gadget consists of two overlapping cycles, which only one of can be selected. Each of the cycles, when selected, starts a donation chain that can satisfied up to two patients representing positive literals $p_x$ or up to two patients representing negative literals $p_{\neg{x}}$, as it is show in \textbf{(a)} and \textbf{(b)}. Notice, that in this construction
