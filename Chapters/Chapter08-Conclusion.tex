\section{Summary}



\section{Limitations and Outlook}

While our work provides a theoretical foundation for kidney exchange with multiple donors, several limitations remain. In real-world kidney exchange programs, many additional factors must be considered. Patients are often prioritized based on factors such as waiting time or medical urgency, and compatibility edges are typically weighted to reflect the probability of a successful transplant rather than being binary. Moreover, patients often participate through hospitals or organizations, rather than individually. Finally, our model assumes a static, one-shot matching process, whereas real kidney exchange programs are dynamic and continuously evolving over time.

Therefore, future work could extend our model to incorporate the practical complexities outlined above. Additionally, in \autoref{cha:approximation}, our inapproximability results are primarily derived via reductions from problems in \autoref{cha:computational_complexity_analysis}. Further insights may be obtained by exploring alternative techniques beyond classical reductions.
